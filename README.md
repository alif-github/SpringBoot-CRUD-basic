# SpringBoot-CRUD-basic
Spring Boot deliver to database just run with database dependency. we can create the management data as easy as use because spring already support.
CRUD with basic code make it the data management being simple. to communication with FE, I use the PostMan to control resp dan req the JSON for Post,
Get, Put, Delete. Hoppefully you can learn my code and wish you all giving me an idea.
